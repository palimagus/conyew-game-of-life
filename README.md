# Game Of Life with Yew

Hello fellow Rustaceans ! This is my implementation of the Conway's Game Of Life using only Rust !

I wanted to work on animation with canvas so I can render things with Rust without using any graphics libraries that are kinda hard to implement for me today.

So I did it using the yew, web-sys and wasm-bindgen packages ðŸ“¦.

## Installation

You will need to install Trunk to build the project. Everthing you need to know is on the [Trunk's website](https://trunkrs.dev/).

Next just install the dependencies with `cargo build` and run the project with `trunk serve`.

Thanks for reading and have a nice day ! ðŸŒž
